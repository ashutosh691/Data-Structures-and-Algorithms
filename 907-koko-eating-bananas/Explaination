# Koko Eating Bananas

The problem is to determine the minimum integer speed at which Koko can eat all the banana piles within `h` hours. Each pile contains a certain number of bananas, and in one hour Koko can eat at most `k` bananas from a single pile. If a pile has fewer than `k` bananas, she eats the entire pile in that hour.

For example, given `piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]` and `h = 8`, the minimum eating speed is `4`.

The intuition behind this solution is to apply **binary search on the answer**. The minimum possible eating speed is `1`, and the maximum possible eating speed is the size of the largest pile. For any chosen speed `k`, we can calculate how many hours it would take to finish all piles. If the total time exceeds `h`, the speed is too slow; otherwise, it is fast enough, and we try to minimize it.

This works because as the eating speed increases, the total hours required decreases monotonically, making binary search applicable.

Pseudocode:
- Set `left = 1` and `right = maximum value in piles`
- While `left <= right`:
  - Compute `mid` as the candidate eating speed
  - Calculate total hours required using:
    - hours += ceil(piles[i] / mid)
  - If total hours ≤ `h`, reduce the search space to the left
  - Else, increase the search space to the right
- Return `left` as the minimum valid speed

Dry Run:

Input:
piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]
h = 8

Binary search steps:

- left = 1, right = 11 → mid = 6  
  hours = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 ≤ 8 → speed is valid → move left

- left = 1, right = 5 → mid = 3  
  hours = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 > 8 → speed too slow → move right

- left = 4, right = 5 → mid = 4  
  hours = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 ≤ 8 → valid → move left

- left = 4, right = 3 → stop

Final Answer:
4

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n log m), where `n` is the number of piles and `m` is the maximum pile size.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) since no extra space proportional to input size is used.

This binary search approach is efficient, clean, and widely used in optimization problems where the answer lies in a range.
