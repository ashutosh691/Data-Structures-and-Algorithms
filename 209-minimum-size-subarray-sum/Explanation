# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

The problem is to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to a given target value. You are given an integer `target` and an array of positive integers `nums`. If there is no such subarray, the answer should be `0`.

For example, if `target = 7` and `nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`, the subarray `[4, 3]` has the minimum length `2` whose sum is at least `7`.

The intuition behind this solution is to use the **sliding window technique**. Since all numbers in the array are positive, increasing the window size increases the sum, and decreasing the window size decreases the sum. This property allows us to efficiently adjust the window to find the smallest valid subarray.

We maintain a window using two pointers. The right pointer expands the window by adding elements to the current sum. Once the sum becomes greater than or equal to the target, we try to shrink the window from the left to find the minimum possible length while still satisfying the condition. At each valid window, we update the minimum length.

This approach ensures that every element is visited at most twice, making the solution efficient.

Pseudocode:
Initialize j = 0, sum = 0, ans = infinity  
For i from 0 to n - 1  
Add nums[i] to sum  
While sum ≥ target  
Update ans = min(ans, i − j + 1)  
Subtract nums[j] from sum  
Increment j  
If ans is still infinity, return 0  
Else return ans  

Dry Run:

Input:
target = 7  
nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]

Step-by-step execution:

- i = 0 → sum = 2 → sum < 7  
- i = 1 → sum = 5 → sum < 7  
- i = 2 → sum = 6 → sum < 7  
- i = 3 → sum = 8 → sum ≥ 7  
  window = [2,3,1,2] → length = 4 → ans = 4  
  shrink window → sum = 6, j = 1  

- i = 4 → sum = 10 → sum ≥ 7  
  window = [3,1,2,4] → length = 4 → ans = 4  
  shrink → sum = 7, j = 2  
  window = [1,2,4] → length = 3 → ans = 3  
  shrink → sum = 6, j = 3  

- i = 5 → sum = 9 → sum ≥ 7  
  window = [2,4,3] → length = 3 → ans = 3  
  shrink → sum = 7, j = 4  
  window = [4,3] → length = 2 → ans = 2  
  shrink → sum = 3, j = 5  

Final Answer:
2

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n) because each element is added to and removed from the window at most once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) since only a constant amount of extra space is used.

This sliding window approach is optimal and widely used in subarray problems involving sum constraints.
